## Current Processes:

# Question to be answered: What factors can contribute to diabetes?
Using Python, we have cleansed the data for analysis. Using SQL, we have created tables and a database to house the currrent dataset. Using Tableau, we will facilitate our presentation as well as show our interactive dashboard. Using MachineLearning models, we will test the accuracy of the data.
