# Final Project - Diabetes Factors
## Question to be answered: 
What correlations between behavioral and physical indicators of diabetes can be identified given the relevant factors available in our data set (i.e. hypertension, bmi, heart disease, smoking history, etc.)?

## Members:
- Bradley
- Christopher
- Laine
## Technologies:
- Jupyter Notebook/Python
- SQL
- MachineLearning/Confusion Matrix - Accuracy Score
- Tableau/Visualizations - story telling
## Current Processes:
- Bradley has created a clean data set through Python coding and SQL database/tables.
- Laine has placed the CSV in MachineLearning -  and pre-processed the data leading up to training the model.
- Christopher is working on Tableau visualization/interactive dashboard showcasing the likelihood of diabetes based on factors.
## Challenges:
- Identifying proper MachineLearning techniques to coding. Trouble rectifying the data set question to the MachineLearning.


Using Python, we have cleansed the data for analysis. 
Using SQL, we have created tables and a database to house the currrent dataset. 
Using Tableau, we will facilitate our presentation as well as show our interactive dashboard. 
Using MachineLearning models, we will use Classifiers (Random Forest, etc.) to analyze the data.
