# Final Project - Diabetes Factors
## Data Source Details: Selected due to data integrity and analysis behind what can cause or be a factor in having diabetes.
Diabetes dataset pulled from online data source Kaggle. This dataset highlights a certain amount of the population and their health information revolving around whether or not they have diabetes.
## Question to be answered: 
What correlations can be made by age group w/different factors identified (i.e. hypertension, bmi, heart disease, smoking history, etc.)?

## Members:
- Bradley

- Laine
### Communicate through Slack every day concerning progress of personal tasks.
## Technologies:
- Jupyter Notebook/Python
- SQL
- MachineLearning/Confusion Matrix - Accuracy Score
- Tableau/Visualizations - story telling
## Current Processes:
- Bradley has created a clean data set through Python coding and SQL database/tables.
- Laine has placed the CSV in MachineLearning -  and pre-processed the data leading up to training the model.
- Christopher is working on Tableau visualization/interactive dashboard showcasing the likelihood of diabetes based on factors.
## Challenges:
- Identifying proper MachineLearning techniques to coding. Trouble rectifying the data set question to the MachineLearning.


Using Python, we have cleansed the data for analysis. 
Using SQL, we have created tables and a database to house the currrent dataset. 
Using Tableau, we will facilitate our presentation as well as show our interactive dashboard. 
Using MachineLearning models, we will use Classifiers (Random Forest, etc.) to analyze the data.
