# Final Project - Diabetes Factors

## Members:
- Bradley
- Christopher
- Laine
## Technologies:
- Jupyter Notebook/Python
- SQL
- MachineLearning/Confusion Matrix - Accuracy Score
- Tableau/Visualizations - story telling
## Current Processes:
- Bradley has created a clean data set through Python coding and SQL database/table creation.
- Laine has placed the CSV in MachineLearning and pre-processed the data leading up to training the model.
## Challenges:
- Identifying proper MachineLearning techniques to coding. Trouble rectifying the data set question to the MachineLearning.

# Question to be answered: What factors can contribute to diabetes?
Using Python, we have cleansed the data for analysis. Using SQL, we have created tables and a database to house the currrent dataset. Using Tableau, we will facilitate our presentation as well as show our interactive dashboard. Using MachineLearning models, we will test the accuracy of the data.
